This directory contains examples for the chem language.

You can view the graphical display of the examples by calling

    @g@chem <file> | groff -p ...

On the displays, you can see rings consisting of several lines and
bonds (lines).  All points on rings and bonds that do not have a
notation mean a C atom (carbon) filled with H atoms (hydrogen) such
that the valence of 4 is satisfied.

For example, suppose you have just a single line without any
characters.  That means a bond.  It has two points, one at each end of
the line.  So each of these points stands for a C atom, the bond
itself connects these 2 C atoms.  To fulfill the valence of 4, each
points has to carry additionally 3 H atoms.  So the single empty bond
stands for CH3-CH3, though this combination doesn't make much sense
chemically.
