chem is a preprocessor for *roff formatters that generates chemical
structure diagrams in the pic language.

The original version of chem is an AWK script written by Brian
Kernighan, formerly sited at <http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/bwk/
ndex.html>.  Historically, the source files of the AWK version of chem
are available at <http://cm.bell-labs.com/netlib/typesetting/chem.gz>.

This project is a rewrite in Perl of the AWK version of chem for groff,
the GNU roff project.  It was written using Perl v5.8.8, but at least
Perl v5.6 is needed to run this Perl version of chem.

In comparison to the original AWK version of chem, this Perl version
makes the following changes.

- Adds options -h, --help, -v, and --version to output usage and version
  information.
- Removes some functions "inline", "shiftfields", and "set", and some
  variables that are used only once.

The subdirectory "examples/" contains example files for chem.  They are
written in the chem language.  The file names end with .chem.
